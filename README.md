# RSA-Key-Pair-Generator
In the following example we will be Base64 encoding the public and private keys to ease the sharing of these keys.


What's is RSA 


RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key stored in private. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factorizing the product of two large primes, the "factoring problem". The abbreviation RSA consists of the initial letters of the surnames Ron Rivest, ADI Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1978. Clifford Cox, an English mathematician working at the British intelligence Agency government communications (GCHQ), developed an equivalent system in 1973, but it wasn't declassified until 1997.

 


A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large Prime numbers along with an optional value. Prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with the help of published in this the moment of the methods, and if the public key is large enough, only someone who knows Prime numbers can decrypt the message. The RSA encryption violation is known as the RSA problem. The question remains as to how difficult this is as a factoring problem.




RSA is a relatively slow algorithm and is therefore less likely to be used for direct encryption of user data. Most often, RSA sends encrypted shared keys for encryption with a symmetric key, which in turn can perform bulk encryption. encryption-decryption operations are much faster.
